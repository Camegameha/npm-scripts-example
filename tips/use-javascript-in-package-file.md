Sorry if this is the wrong place (don't want to have to get a Twitter account and couldn't find your email anywhere) but wanted to ping you about this thing since "JSON is restrictive" is the biggest drawback of npm scripts.

This seems to fix it. Let me know what you think and if you think of any cool ways to use it.
